# Vehicle Routing Problem using Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a solution to the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**. The problem involves finding the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of locations while minimizing the total travel distance.

## Problem Description

The **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles that deliver goods to a set of locations. The key objectives are:
- Minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles.
- Ensure that the routes are balanced across all vehicles (minimizing the variance in distance between vehicles).

In this project, we use a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve the VRP by evolving solutions through processes such as selection, crossover, and mutation.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following steps:
1. **Dataset Generation**: Randomly generating a set of locations for the VRP.
2. **Genetic Algorithm Setup**: Representing routes, applying genetic operators (crossover, mutation), and selecting individuals based on fitness scores.
3. **Fitness Function**: The fitness function evaluates the total distance and the standard deviation (for balancing vehicle routes) of a given solution.
4. **Solution Plotting**: Visualizing the optimal solution found by the genetic algorithm.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

- `matplotlib`: For plotting the routes.
- `deap`: For implementing the genetic algorithm.

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib deap

```

## Usage

### Task 1: Install Libraries

To get started, ensure that the required libraries are installed:

### Task 2: Define Locations and Vehicles

In this task, you can customize the number of delivery locations and vehicles in the fleet. The locations are randomly generated, and there is a fixed depot (starting/ending point) that all vehicles share.

#### Parameters to Modify:
- **`num_locations`**: The total number of delivery locations that need to be served. This can be adjusted based on the problem's requirements.
- **`num_vehicles`**: The number of vehicles in the fleet that will be used to service the locations.
- **`depot`**: A fixed starting and ending point for all vehicles. This is the location where all vehicles start and return after completing their deliveries.


### Task 3: Genetic Algorithm Setup

In this task, the genetic algorithm is implemented using the **DEAP** library. Each individual in the population represents a potential solution to the **Vehicle Routing Problem** and is encoded as a list of locations. The goal is to optimize the routes taken by the vehicles while minimizing the total travel distance and ensuring balanced routes across vehicles.

#### Genetic Algorithm Components:
- **Individual Encoding**: Each individual represents a route by encoding locations in a list. This list is a permutation of the locations, with the depot (starting/ending point) fixed for all vehicles.
- **Fitness Function**: The fitness function evaluates each individual by calculating:
  - The **total travel distance** of all vehicles combined.
  - The **variance** of the travel distances among the vehicles, ensuring a balanced workload.

### Task 4: Genetic Operators

In this task, we define and implement the genetic operators used in the genetic algorithm. These operators include **Selection**, **Crossover**, and **Mutation**, which are essential for evolving the population and improving solutions over generations.

### Task 5: Fitness Evaluation

The **fitness function** plays a critical role in evaluating how good a solution is during the genetic algorithm. It calculates two key metrics for each individual (route solution) in the population:

1. **Total Distance**: The total distance traveled by all vehicles in the route.
2. **Standard Deviation of Distances**: This measures the balance of the routes across all vehicles. The goal is to minimize the standard deviation to ensure that all vehicles are assigned approximately the same workload (in terms of travel distance).

#### Fitness Function Design:
The fitness function calculates the total distance and the balance (standard deviation) of the routes for all vehicles. A lower total distance indicates a more efficient solution, and a lower standard deviation indicates more balanced vehicle routes.

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the fitness evaluation function:

### Task 6: Visualization

The **plot_routes** function visualizes the routes taken by each vehicle in the solution. It plots the depot and delivery locations on a 2D plane and draws lines connecting the locations for each vehicle's route.

#### Visualization Details:
- **Depot**: The starting and ending point for all vehicles is shown as a red square (`rs`).
- **Locations**: The delivery locations are plotted as blue circles (`bo`).
- **Routes**: Each vehicle's route is visualized with a line connecting the locations, showing the path taken by the vehicle from the depot to the locations and back.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Model Comparison**:  
   - Integrate and compare additional models like **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. This will help evaluate the performance of the genetic algorithm-based approach against other machine learning models for vehicle routing problems.

2. **Improved Feature Engineering**:  
   - Explore advanced techniques for feature extraction from raw sensor data, including **temporal feature extraction** and **advanced signal processing** methods. This could further enhance the model's performance and robustness, especially for real-time applications.

3. **Web Application**:  
   - Develop and deploy the model as a **web application**. This would allow users to interactively input data (e.g., locations, vehicle specifications) and get real-time optimized solutions for vehicle routing.
